How to install Regetron in Cloud 9

A. create a repo to hold all your stuff
B. Clone it into cloud9
C. In the console do the stuff that our dear teacher and overlord has already written:
 - git clone git://gitorious.org/regetron/regetron.git
 - cd regetron
 - python setup.py install
avoid the sudo as c9 dislikes it, and we want c9 happy.
